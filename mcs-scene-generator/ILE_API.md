## Classes

Some [configurable ILE options](#Options) use the following classes
(represented as dicts in the YAML):

#### AgentActionConfig

Represents what animations an agent is to perform.
- `id` (str or list of str): The ID of the animation the agent should
perform.  Default: no deafult, must be set.
- `step_begin` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict):
The step in that this animation should start.
Default: no default, must be set.
- `step_end` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict):
The step in that this animation should end.
Default: unset - animation won't end until another animation changes it or
the animation finishes.
- `is_loop_animation` (bool or list of bool): Determines whether the
animation should loop or end when finished.  Default: False

#### AgentConfig

variations) that will be added to each scene. Each template can have the
following optional properties:
- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict): The number
of agents with this template to generate in each scene. For a list or a
MinMaxInt, a new number will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: `1`
- `actions` ([AgentActionConfig](#AgentActionConfig)) or list of
([AgentActionConfig](#AgentActionConfig)): The config for agent actions
or animations.  Enties in a list are NOT choices.  Each entry will be kept
and any randomness will be reconciled inside the entry.

([AgentMovementConfig](#AgentMovementConfig)): The config for agent
movement.
- `agent_settings` ([AgentSettings](#AgentSettings) or list of
[AgentSettings](#AgentSettings)): The settings that describe how an agent
will look. Default: random
- `position` ([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, or list of
VectorFloatConfig dicts): The position of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new position will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random
- `rotation_y` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict):
The rotation of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new rotation will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random
- `type`: (string or list of strings) string to indicate the model of
agent to use.  Options are: agent_female_01, agent_female_02,
agent_female_04, agent_male_02, agent_male_03, agent_male_04.
Default: random
- `keyword_location`: ([KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig)):
One of the keyword locations for this agent or set of agents. Any choices
in `keyword_location` are made for each object inside the group, not the
group as a whole.

Example:
```

type: agent_female_02
agent_settings:
  chest: 2
  eyes: 1
position:
  x: 3
  z: 3

'points' field is set, the 'bounds' and 'num_points' fields will
be ignored.
- `animation` (str or list of str): Determines animation that
should occur while movement is happening.
Default: 'TPM_walk' or 'TPM_run'

set of movements should loop or end when finished.
Default: Random

#### AgentSettings

Describes the appearance of the agent.  Detailed information can be
found in the MCS schema documentation.  All values Default to a random
value in the full range of that value.

#### AgentTargetConfig

Defines details of the shortcut_agent_with_target shortcut.  This shortcut
creates a room with an agent holding a target soccer ball.  The agent's
position can be specified.

- `movement_bounds` (list of [VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig))
points to generate a polygon that bounds the agents random movement.
If the polygon has an area of 0, no movement will occur.  Polygons with
only 1 or 2 points will have an area of 0 and therefore will have no
movement.  Default: entire room

#### BisectingPlatformConfig

Defines details of the shortcut_bisecting_platform shortcut.  This shortcut
creates a platform that bisects the room, where the performer will start.
On default, a blocking wall is on that platform, forcing the performer
to choose a side to drop off of the platform, but this can be disabled.
- `has_blocking_wall` (bool): Enables the blocking wall so that the
performer has to stop and choose a side of the room. Default: True
- `has_long_blocking_wall` (bool): Enables the long blocking wall used in
Spatial Reorientation tasks. Overrides `has_blocking_wall`. Default: False

#### FloorAreaConfig

Defines an area of the floor of the room.  Note: Coordinates must be
integers. Areas are always size 1x1 centered on the given X/Z coordinate.
Adjacent areas are combined.

- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or list of
MinMaxInt dicts): Number of areas to be used with these parameters
- `position_x` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or
list of MinMaxInt dicts): X position of the area.
- `position_z` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or
list of MinMaxInt dicts): Z position of the area.

#### FloorMaterialConfig

Defines details of a specific material on a specific location of the
floor.  Be careful if num is greater than 1, be sure there are
possibilities such that enough floor areas can be generated.

the given X/Z coordinate. Adjacent areas are combined.

- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or list of
MinMaxInt dicts): Number of areas to be used with these parameters
- `material` (string, or list of strings): The floor's material or
material type.
- `position_x` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or
list of MinMaxInt dicts): X position of the area.
- `position_z` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or
list of MinMaxInt dicts): Z position of the area.

#### GoalConfig

A dict with str `category` and optional `target` or `targets` properties
that correspond to the goal and target object(s) in each scene.

The goal `category` for interactive scenes is either `"retrieval"` (for
one target) or `"multi retrieval"` (for multiple targets). If the
`category` is not set, it will default to `"retrieval"` if `target` is set
or `"multi retrieval"` if `targets` is set.

The goal `category` for passive scenes is either `"intuitive physics"`
(for passive physics scenes), `"agents"` (for NYU passive agent scenes), or
`"passive"` (for all other passive scenes). Please see
`passive_physics_scene` for making passive physics scenes. Please do not
use the ILE Scene Generator for making NYU passive agent scenes.

See the MCS Python API for more information about the goal categories:

https://nextcenturycorporation.github.io/MCS/api.html#machine_common_sense.GoalCategory

The `target` property is only needed for `"retrieval"` scenes, and the
`targets` property is only needed for `"multi retrieval"` scenes.
The `target` property is either an InteractableObjectConfig dict or a list
of InteractableObjectConfig dicts. For a list, one dict will be randomly
chosen within the list in each new scene. The `targets` property is a list
of InteractableObjectConfig dicts, and ALL the dicts will be used as
targets in each new scene. All goal target objects will be assigned the
'target' label. The `num` property will only be used with multiple
`targets`.

Please note that the `"traversal"` and `"transferral"` goal categories,
along with the `target_1` and `target_2` properties, are no longer
supported.

Example:
```
category: retrieval
target:
    shape: soccer_ball
    scale:
      min: 1.0
      max: 3.0
```

#### InteractableObjectConfig

Represents the template for a specific object (with one or more possible
variations) that will be added to each scene. Each template can have the
following optional properties:
- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict): The number
of objects with this template to generate in each scene. For a list or a
MinMaxInt, a new number will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: `1`
- `num_targets_minus` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt)
dict): Overrides the `num` option. Count the total number of targets,
subtract `num_targets_minus` from the count, and generate that many
objects. For example, in a scene with 5 targets, a `num_targets_minus` of
1 would generate 4 objects. Default: null
- `dimensions` ([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, int,
[MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt), or a list of any of those types): Sets the overal
dimensions of the object in meters.  This field will override scale.
Default: Use scale.
- `identical_to` (str): Used to match to another object with
the specified label, so that this definition can share that object's
exact shape, scale, and material. Overrides `identical_except_color`
- `identical_except_color` (str): Used to match to another object with
the specified label, so that this definition can share that object's
exact shape and scale, but not its material (color/texture).
- `keyword_location`: ([KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig)):
Used to identify one of the qualitative locations specified by keywords.
This field should not be set when `position` or `rotation` are also set.
- `labels` (string, or list of strings): labels to associate with this
object.  Components can use this label to reference this object or a group
of objects.  Labels do not need to be unique and when objects share a
labels, components have options to randomly choose one or choose all.  See
specific label options for details.
- `locked` (bool or list of bools): If true and the resulting object is
lockable, like a container or door, the object will be locked.  If the
object is not lockable, this field has no affect.
- `material` (string, or list of strings): The material (color/texture) to
use on this object in each scene. For a list, a new material will be
randomly chosen for each scene. Default: random

that share the same colors as this material, on this object. Default: none
- `position` ([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, or list of
VectorFloatConfig dicts): The position of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new position will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random
- `position_relative` ([RelativePositionConfig](#RelativePositionConfig)
dict, or list of RelativePositionConfig dicts): Configuration options for
positioning this object relative to another object, rather than using
`position`. If configuring this as a list, then all listed options will be
applied to each scene in the listed order, with later options overriding
earlier options if necessary. Default: not used
- `rotation` ([VectorIntConfig](#VectorIntConfig) dict, or list of
VectorIntConfig dicts): The rotation of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new rotation will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random

or list of MinMaxFloat dicts, or [VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig)
dict, or list of VectorFloatConfig dicts): The scale of this object in each
scene. A single float will be used as the scale for all object dimensions
(X/Y/Z). For a list or a MinMaxFloat, a new scale will be randomly chosen
for each scene. This field can be overriden by 'dimensions'. Default: `1`
- `shape` (string, or list of strings): The shape (object type) of this
object in each scene. For a list, a new shape will be randomly chosen for
each scene. Default: random
- `rotate_cylinders` (bool): Whether or not to rotate cylindrical shapes
along their x axis so that they are placed on their round sides (needed
for collision scenes). This would only apply to these shapes: 'cylinder',
'double_cone', 'dumbbell_1', 'dumbbell_2', 'tie_fighter', 'tube_narrow',
'tube_wide'. Note that this will override any x rotation previously
specified by 'rotation'. Default: False

#### KeywordLocationConfig

Describes an object's keyword location. Can have the following
properties:
- `keyword` (string, or list of strings): The keyword location, which can
be one of the following:
    - `adjacent` - The object will be placed next to another object.  The
    other object must be referenced by the 'relative_object_label' field.
    - `adjacent_performer` - The object will be placed next to the
    performer.  The object can be placed in 'front', 'back', left, or
    'right' of the performer using the 'direction'.  The object
    can also be specified to be 'in_reach' or 'out_of_reach' via the
    'distance'.  By default, the object will be placed in a random
    direction, but 'in_reach'.
    other object must be referenced by the 'relative_object_label' field.
    If multiple objects have this label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `back` - The object will be placed in the 180 degree arc behind the
    performer's start position.
    - `behind` - The object will be placed behind another object, relative
    to the performer's start position.  The other object must be referenced
    by the 'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have this
    label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `between` - The object will be placed between the performer's start
    position and another object.  The other object must be referenced by
    the 'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have this
    label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `front` - The object will be placed in a line in front of the
    performer's start position.
    - `in` - The object will be placed inside a container.  The container
    must be referenced by the 'container_label' field.  If multiple objects
    have this label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `in_with` - The object will be placed inside a container along with
    another object.  The container must be referenced by the
    'container_label' field.  The other object must be referenced by the
    'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have these label,
    one will be randomly chosen for each field.
    - `occlude` - The object will be placed between the performer's start
    position and another object so that this object completely occludes the
    view of the other object.  The other object must be referenced by
    the 'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have this
    label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `on_center` - The object will be placed on top of another object
    in the center of the bounds.  This option is best for objects the are
    similar in size or for use cases where objects are desired to be
    centered.  The object must be referenced by the 'relative_object_label'
    field.  If multiple objects have this label,
    one will be randomly chosen.
    - `on_top` - The object will be placed on top of another object in a
    random location.  This option is best for when the object is
    significantly smaller than the object it is placed on (I.E. a small
    ball on a large platform).  If the objects are similar in size
    (I.E. two bowls), use 'on_center'.  The object must be referenced by
    the 'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have this
    label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `opposite_x` - The object will be placed in the exact same location
    as the object referenced by `relative_object_label` except that its x
    location will be on the opposite side of the room.  There is no
    adjustments to find a valid location if another object already exists
    in location specified by this keyword.
    - `opposite_z` - The object will be placed in the exact same location
    as the object referenced by `relative_object_label` except that its z
    location will be on the opposite side of the room.  There is no
    adjustments to find a valid location if another object already exists
    in location specified by this keyword.
    - `random` - The object will be positioned in a random location, as if
    it did not have a keyword location.
    - `associated_with_agent` - This object will be held by an agent
    referenced by the 'relative_object_label' field.
    - `along_wall` - This object will be placed along a wall
    referenced by the 'relative_object_label' field.  The wall labels are
    'front_wall', 'back_wall', 'left_wall, and 'right_wall'.  If no wall is
    provided, a wall will be chosen at random.
- `container_label` (string, or list of strings): The label of a container
object that already exists in your configuration. Only required by some
keyword locations.
- `relative_object_label` (string, or list of strings): The label of a
second object that already exists in your configuration. Only required by
some keyword locations.
- `position_relative_to_start` (VectorFloatConfig, or list of
VectorFloatConfigs): Currently only supported with the `on_center` keyword:
How much to translate object from the center position of the relative
object along the x and z axis. This works like a percentage, represented
as x/z values that range from -1.0 to 1.0 (with both of those values being
furthest from the center in either direction). Note that this assumes the
relative object has a rectangular boundary.

#### KeywordObjectsConfig

Describes a single group of a keyword objects.  Keyword objects has the
following properties:
- `keyword` (string, or list of strings): The type of object, like
confusor, container, obstacle, or occluder.
If an array is given, one will be chosen for each creation of this group.
    - `"asymmetric_containers"`: Asymmetric open-topped containers.
    Subset of `"open_topped_containers"`. Used in interactive support
    relations tasks.
    - `"bins"`: Bin-like containers. Subset of `"open_topped_containers"`.
    Used in interactive spatial reorientation tasks.
    - `"confusors"`: Objects that are similar to the target in two of the
    following: color, shape, size.
    - `"containers"`: Receptacles that can contain other objects and can
    open and close, like chests.  These containers can be of any size.
    - `"containers_can_contain_target"`: Receptacles that can contain other
    objects and can open and close, like chests.  These containers
    will be large enough to contain the target.  If a goal target does
    not exist, generation will fail.
    - `"containers_cannot_contain_target"`: Receptacles that can contain
    other objects and can open and close, like chests.  These containers
    will not be large enough to contain the target.  If a goal target does
    not exist, generation will fail.
    - `"context"`: Objects (also called "distractors") that are small,
    pickupable, and serve to clutter the room to possibly distract the AI.
    They are never the same shape as the target object, if the scene has a
    goal with a target object.
    - `"obstacles"`: Objects that prevent movement through/under them but
    allow sight through them, like chairs or tables with four individual
    legs.
    - `"occluders"`: Objects that prevent both movement through/under them
    AND sight through them, like sofas or bookcases with solid back panels.
    This is completely different from the occluders in passive
    intuitive physics scenes.
    - `"open_topped_containers"`: Objects that can contain other objects
    but have no lid and open tops instead.
    - `"symmetric_containers"`: Symmetric open-topped containers.
    Subset of `"open_topped_containers"`. Used in interactive support
    relations tasks.

in `keyword_location` are made for each object inside the group, not the
group as a whole. Overrides any configured `position` and `rotation`.
- `labels` (string, or list of strings): labels to associate with this
object.  Components can use this label to reference this object or a group
of objects.  Labels do not need to be unique and when objects share a
labels, components have options to randomly choose one or choose all.  See
specific label options for details.
- `position` ([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, or list of
VectorFloatConfig dicts): The position of these objects in each scene. If
given a list, a position will be randomly chosen for each object and each
scene. Is overridden by the `keyword_location`. Default: random
- `position_relative` ([RelativePositionConfig](#RelativePositionConfig)
dict, or list of RelativePositionConfig dicts): Configuration options for
positioning this object relative to another object, rather than using
`position`. If configuring this as a list, then all listed options will be
applied to each scene in the listed order, with later options overriding
earlier options if necessary. Default: not used
- `rotation` ([VectorIntConfig](#VectorIntConfig) dict, or list of
VectorIntConfig dicts): The rotation of these objects in each scene. If
given a list, a rotation will be randomly chosen for each object and each
scene. Is overridden by the `keyword_location`. Default: random

in the scene. For each list, one float will be randomly chosen from the
list in each new scene; for each MinMaxFloat, one float will be randomly
chosen from within the corresponding range in each new scene.

Example:
```
x:
    - -0.5
    - -0.25
    - 0
    - 0.25
    - 0.5
y: 0.1
z:
    min: -0.5
    max: 0.5
```

#### VectorIntConfig

A dict with `x`, `y`, and `z` properties (each of which are either an
int, list of ints, or MinMaxInt) that represents a global coordinate
in the scene. For each list, one int will be randomly chosen from the
list in each new scene; for each MinMaxInt, one int will be randomly
chosen from within the corresponding range in each new scene.

Example:
```
x:
    - -1
    - 0
    - 1
y: 0
z:
    min: -1
    max: 1
```


## Options

You may set the following options in your ILE (YAML) config file:

#### auto_last_step

(bool, or list of bools): Determines if the last step should automatically
be determined by room size.  The last step is calculated such that the
performer can walk in a circle along the walls of the room approximately 5
times.  If 'last_step' is set, that field takes
precedence.  Default: False

Simple Example:
```
auto_last_step: False
```

Advanced Example:
```
auto_last_step: True
```

#### ceiling_material

(string, or list of strings): A single material for the ceiling, or a

each scene. Default: random

Simple Example:
```
ceiling_material: null
```

Advanced Example:
```
ceiling_material: "Custom/Materials/GreyDrywallMCS"
```

#### check_valid_path

(bool): If true, checks for a valid path between the performer agent's
starting position and the target's position and retries generating the
current scene if one cannot be found. Considers all objects and structures
that would block the performer when their position is y = 0 or are light
enough to be pushed. The check considers all holes and areas of lava in the
scene. It also considers moving up and/or down ramps that are attached to
platforms (via the `attached_ramps` option in `structural_platforms`), as
well as across those platforms. Pathfinding is otherwise only done in two
dimensions. This check is skipped if false. Please note that this feature
is not currently supported for scenes containing multiple targets.
Default: False

Simple Example:
```
check_valid_path: false
```

Advanced Example:
```
check_valid_path: true
```

ranges and choices, the ILE will retry on overlaps.  This field must be
blank or an empty array if `passive_scene` is `true`.

Simple Example:
```
freezes: null
```

Advanced Example:
```
freezes:
  -
    begin: 1

```

Advanced Example:
```
passive_physics_floor: True
```

#### passive_physics_scene

(bool): Setup each scene in exactly the same way as the "passive physics"
scenes used in the MCS evaluations, including the camera position, room
dimensions, floor friction, and restrictions on only "Pass" actions.
Default: False

Simple Example:
```
passive_physics_scene: False
```

Advanced Example:
```
passive_physics_scene: True
```

#### passive_scene

(bool): Determine if scene should be considered passive and the
performer agent should be restricted to only use the `"Pass"` action.
If true, ILE will raise an exception if last_step is not set or either
`circles`, `freezes`, `swivels` or `teleports` has any entries.
Redundant if the `passive_physics_scene` config option is `true`.
Default: `false`

#### performer_look_at

(string or list of strings): If set, configures the performer to start
looking at an object found by the label matching the string given.
Overrides `performer_start_rotation`.
Default: Use `performer_start_rotation`

#### performer_start_position

([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, or list of VectorFloatConfig
dicts or [KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig)): The starting
position of the performer agent, or a list of
positions, from which one is chosen at random for each scene. The
(optional) `y` is used to position on top of structural objects like
platforms. Valid parameters are constrained by room dimensions.
`x` and `z` positions must be positioned within half of the room
dimension bounds minus an additional 0.25 to account for the performer
width. For example: in a room where 'dimension x = 5', valid
`x` parameters would be '4.75, MinMaxFloat(-4.75, 4.75) and
[-4.75, 0, 4.75].' In the case of variable room dimensions that use a
MinMaxInt or list, valid parameters are bound by the maximum room
dimension. For example: with 'dimension `x` = MinMax(5, 7) or [5, 6, 7]
valid x parameters would be '3.25, MinMaxFloat(-3.25, 3.25), and
[-3.25, 0, 3.25].' For `y` start and room dimensions, the min y position
must always be greater than 0 and the max must always be less than or equal
to room dimension y - 1.25.' This ensures the performer does not clip
into the ceiling. Alternatively, the performer start can be a
[KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig).  Performer only supports
the following keyword locations: `along_wall`
Default: random within the room

Simple Example:
```
performer_start_position: null

#### room_dimensions

([VectorIntConfig](#VectorIntConfig) dict, or list of VectorIntConfig
dicts): The total dimensions for the room, or list of dimensions, from
which one is chosen at random for each scene. Rooms are always rectangular
or square. The X and Z must each be within [2, 100] and the Y must be
within [2, 10]. The room's bounds will be [-X/2, X/2] and [-Z/2, Z/2].

      z: 0
```

#### shortcut_bisecting_platform

(bool or [BisectingPlatformConfig](#BisectingPlatformConfig)):
Creates a platform bisecting the room.  If True, the default behavior will
be that the performer starts on one end with a blocking wall in front of
them such that the performer is forced to make a choice on which side they
want to drop off and they cannot get back to the other side. This overrides
the `performer_start_position` and `performer_start_rotation`, if
configured. Note that the blocking wall can be disabled if needed.
Default: False

```
shortcut_bisecting_platform: False
```

Advanced Example:

Creates a room with a goal object on an island surrounded by lava.
There will also be a block tool to facilitate acquiring the goal object.
One dimension of the room must be 13 or greater. The other dimension must
be 7 or greater. The max width across for front + island_size + rear is 9.
The min width across for front + island_size + rear is 5. Lava can be
asymmetric but the same restrictions of width min: 5 and max: 9 apply for
left + island_size + right as well.
By default, the target is a soccer ball with scale between 1 and 3.
The tool is a pushable tool object with a length equal
to the span from the front of the lava over the island to the back of the
lava.  It will have a width of either 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. Default: False

Simple Example:
```
shortcut_lava_target_tool: False
```

Advanced Example:
```
shortcut_lava_target_tool:
  island_size:
    min: 1

  guide_rails: [True, False]
```

#### shortcut_start_on_platform

(bool): Ensures that the performer will start on top of a platform. In
order for this to work, `structural_platforms` needs to be specified
using the label `start_structure`. This ignores any configured
`performer_start_position` setting. Default: False

Simple Example:
```
shortcut_start_on_platform: False
```

Advanced Example:
```
shortcut_start_on_platform: True
```

#### shortcut_triple_door_choice

(bool or [TripleDoorConfig](#TripleDoorConfig)):
Creates a platform bisecting the room with a wall with 3 doors
(a.k.a. door occluder, or "door-cluder" or "doorcluder").
The performer starts on one end such that the performer is forced to make
a choice on which door they want to open.  By default, the doors will be
restricted so only one can be opened.  Will increase the Y room dimension
to 5 if it is lower than 5.  Default: False

Simple Example:
```
shortcut_triple_door_choice: False
```

Advanced Example:
```
shortcut_triple_door_choice:
  start_drop_step:
    min: 2
    max: 5
  add_lips: True
  add_freeze: [True, False]
  restrict_open_doors: True
```

#### side_wall_opposite_colors

(bool, or list of bools): Makes three of the room's walls the same color,
and the other wall (either the left or the right) an opposite color.
